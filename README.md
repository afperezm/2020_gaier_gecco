This is the actual code that was used for the experiments in:

Discovering Representations for Black-box Optimization (Gaier et al., GECCO 2020) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04389)

*Warning*: This is research code, it should work out of the box but it isn't pretty -- we will try to release a better version for public consumption soon.
